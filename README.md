Webscraping-Project-Arbetsförmedlingen
Scraping jobs from the Swedish Public Employment Service website
https://arbetsformedlingen.se/

As part of my NOD Bootcamp project, I worked on webscraping the Arbetsförmedlingen website for jobs related to my interests in the field of data. To achieve this, I used Selenium to scrape information from the website and made sure to accept the 'Cookies' for each URL so that the paths were correct.

In total, I scraped 500 jobs from 20 pages. However, upon analyzing the DataFrame, I found that only around 150 jobs included the keywords Python or SQL. I sorted this information into a new DataFrame to get only those jobs that were of interest to me.

Finally, I presented my findings in a 5-minute presentation to my class in the Bootcamp. Through this project, I gained experience with various libraries, learned to create new DataFrames, and explored new things. I found webscraping to be a fun and exciting way to extract data and insights that are of personal interest.

All of my visualizations from the DataFrames are inside the MP4 file. I uploaded the code I used to create this project, the diffrent DataFrames i made and the MP4 file for the presentation. Please feel free to contact me if you have any insights or questions.
